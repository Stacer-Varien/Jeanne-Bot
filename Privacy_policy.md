# Privacy Policy

This document outlines the privacy policy and agreement that you accept when adding Jeanne (Bot ID 831993597166747679) to a server or as a member of such a server. This document does not supersede the following:

* [Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal)
* [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)
* [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)

## Data Collection

The main data is stored in an SQLite Database. Errors and usage of commands are logged into two separate CSV files. Level cooldowns are stored in a JSON file. The data is backed up in case of changes or failure to prevent data loss and damage. It can only be accessed by the bot's developer, [Stacer Varien](https://github.com/Stacer-Varien). In the event of unintentional data loss or alteration, the developer will try to compensate affected users.

User IDs, server IDs, and channel IDs are the main data stored and kept privately in the database. However, they are not always 100% secure. The data is not sold or given to unauthorized third parties unless required by law or the Terms of Service. The CSV files are cleared with each update.

The user's or server's data is **not registered** in the database if:

1. The user has not sent a message in the server or is sending messages in ignored channels and direct messages between them and the bot, or in a channel where the bot cannot view.
2. A certain command required to add/enter data in the database has not been used at least once.
3. The user has been banned from using the bot.

## Confession Command Policy

The `/confess` command stores anonymous confessions in the database for moderation and user safety purposes. All confessions are retained for **30 days** before being automatically deleted, unless flagged or escalated.

If a confession is **reported** to the developer or moderators by a server member, it will be **reviewed and escalated** based on the severity of the situation. This may involve logging the confession for a longer duration, notifying server administrators, or involving Discord Trust & Safety if necessary.

While all data is kept private and stored securely, users are reminded that misuse of this system—including threats, abuse, or illegal content—may result in permanent blacklisting from the bot and action taken as per Discord's Community Guidelines.

## Data Access

Data can be accessed by everyone but is limited except the bot developer, who has full access to all kinds of data. Level and rank data can be accessed freely, but data such as inventory can only be accessed by the main user.

## Removal of Data

Users are free to request the removal of data by joining the [support server](https://discord.gg/Vfa796yvNq) or by emailing [jeannebot.discord@gmail.com](mailto:jeannebot.discord@gmail.com) to contact the bot developer with valid reasons.

## Questions

If you have any questions concerning this policy, please feel free to join the server and ask or email [jeannebot.discord@gmail.com](mailto:jeannebot.discord@gmail.com).
