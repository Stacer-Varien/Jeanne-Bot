Hello,

As most of you know, Discord is forcing bot developers to implement slash commands into their bots. This has caused Danny, the core and sole maintainer of discord.py to step down.

Jeanne is coded in Python and due to this, I will face a problem with implementing slash commands into her since the official package for it hasn't been released and Danny has made a request to contributors to take over the discord.py but no one has accepted it yet and I personally feel that Discord does not care about the developers. Feels like YouTube also not caring about the creators after COPPA and FTC was brought into the platform as I feel they are in the same WhatsApp group. Not only Danny is affected but other Discord API Library developers are also affected by this and has either stepped down as owners or maintainers of them.

> Will you stop developing Jeanne?
No. I will not stop developing her. I will not let 4+ months of work go to waste (even though I'm a beginner programmer). I've managed to get Jeanne into Top.gg. But if I have to continue developing her, I have 3 choices:

* CHOICE A:

I will use the unstable packages of the slash commands (dislash, discord-py-slash-commands) to implement them. I know they are not the official packages but I know a bot developer who uses them and has implemented it to his bot and they worked well. So I will use them to make sure Jeanne lives and I can continue developing her.

* CHOICE B:

I have to learn another programming language and my 2nd language of choice before I started making the bot was JavaScript and they have the official package of slash commands made. I know JS is a harder langauge than Python but at least I can use the stable release of these packages

* CHOICE C:

I will not implement the slash commands but I will restrict Jeanne from entering 85+ servers as this would cause her to go through the verification process. That will be a major disadvantage to me and to Jeanne but it would cause less stress than setting up the slash commands in my point of view.

> Will slash commands make it easier for me to use the bot?

Well yes but actually no in most cases. Imagine if you had 5+ bots and you want to do userinfo. Then you will stumble upon other bots like Arcane, Dank Memer and Mee6 and you have to scroll way down to look for Jeane to do that command. And it is also not benificial for all bots as they will all have the same prefix (/) and it would be kinda stupid and lame.

> What do I think will happen after April 2022?
I could think of 3 things

* Scenario A:

Discord has listened to the developers and decide to not make the implemention of slash commands compulsory. Some library developers might come back or not to maintain the libraries.

* Scenario B:

Almost all bots, big or small (has reached over 85+ servers and have been verified or in process of verification) has been discontinued, everyone would be sad that their favourite bots has died and considered useless. Most people would leave their bots as they don't want to implement slash commands in them (like I said, stupid and lame).

* Scenario C:

Almost the same as B but someone has forked the libraries to bypass some of the feautres Discord is locking (I am not sure if I'm correct or saying this right).

I will try all my best to make sure Jeanne makes it through April 2022, even if it means changing programming language. Like I said, I will not let my 4+ months go to waste.

Thank you and stay safe
